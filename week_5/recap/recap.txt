Recap from Week 4
(delivered on Week 5)


.gitignore is a special file listing
all files or folders which
you don't want to track with git.


HEAD points to the current commit.

Example:

abcs Update file   <- HEAD
cs61 Create file   <- HEAD~1
hd7s Create folder <- HEAD~2
ad61 Init project  <- HEAD~3


git reflog - a reference log
of all changes tracked by git.

Use reflog to go back in time and
undo any changes.

Terminal

We can use Command Line Interface of a program
to execute commands.

CLI gives us speed and efficiency.

Example:

> cd projects/my_app/src

CLI power comes with flags.

Example:

> git add . -p
Partially stages changes

> ls -la

-l = "long" format (permissions, owner, size)
-a = show "all" (incl. hidden files)

Common flags:

-v = "verbose" output
-f = "force" action
-r = "recursive"
-y = "yes" - auto-confirm

How to know which flags are available?

man
--help

Example:

> git add --help
> man ls

&&

We can run commands
sequentially with &&.

Example:

> git add . && git commit -m "Add new file"

Pipe (|)

Pipe lets you chain commands together,
passing the output of one command
as input to the next.

Example:

> cat log.txt | grep "ERROR" | wc -l

PATH determines locations where the terminal
looks for commands.

To see these locations:

> echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

: - separates different paths

/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin

To fix the error 'Command not found',
do one of the below:

1) Copy the app into one of the folders,
specified in PATH.

> sudo cp hello /usr/local/bin

2) Specify the full path to the command
