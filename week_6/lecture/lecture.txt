Debugging


What is debugging?

In 1947, while working on the Harvard Mark II
electromechanical computer, computer scientist
Grace Hopper and her team encountered an unexpected malfunction.

After investigating, they discovered an actual moth
(bug) trapped in Relay #70 of the machine,
disrupting its operation.

Nowadays, debugging is the way to find the error (bug)
in code and fix it.


When a program doesn’t behave as expected,
developers use debugging techniques to:

1) Locate the source of the problem.
2) Understand why the error occurred.
3) Apply a fix to ensure the code runs correctly.


Common types of bugs in JavaScript

- Syntax errors
- Runtime errors
- Logical errors


Syntax errors (SyntaxError)

- Occur when grammar is wrong.
- Prevent the script from running at all.
- Often caught by code editors (VS Code, IntelliJ).
- Easy to debug.

demo/syntax_error.html

How to debug Syntax errors:

- Check your IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ).
- Check DevTools console
-- it will have file name and line number
   where error occurred


Runtime errors (TypeError or ReferenceError)

- Occur while the code is executing
(after syntax checks pass).
- Often caused by invalid operations.
- Accessing properties of null or undefined.
- Calling non-existent functions.
- You don't usually see the error, until you
run the app.
- These are harder to debug.


Example

console.lg('Hi'); -> TypeError
nonExistentFunction(); -> ReferenceError

Why console.lg() is TypeError and not ReferenceError?

console.lg()
- console has no property called lg
- JavaScript returns undefined.
- undefined() trying to call as a function
- undefined is not a function type -> hence TypeError

nonExistentFunction()
- You call or reference something that
doesn’t exist -> hence ReferenceError

Why we have syntax errors and runtime errors?
Why not all errors are runtime?

If both Syntax errors and Runtime errors
appear when we run our app, why they are
different?

Let's see how JS engine works
when we run our app:

1) Parsing Phase, JS engine:

- Reads your code.
- Checks for grammatical correctness.
- If syntax mistake found -> SyntaxError thrown
- The code never runs.

Example

1: document.getElementsByTagName('h1')[0].textContent = 'Hello world';
2: console.log('Hello world'; <- SyntaxError

Because there is a SyntaxError on line 2,
you don't see <h1>Hello world</h1> from line 1.

The code from line 1 has never run, due to SyntaxError
during Parsing Phase.


2) Execution Phase

- Only if parsing succeeds, the engine starts
executing the code.
- At this phase Runtime errors (TypeError or ReferenceError)
may occur.


Logical errors

- The code runs without crashing.
- App produces incorrect results.
- Hardest to detect (no error message).

Breakpoints

Breakpoints allow you to pause JavaScript execution
at specific line to inspect:

- variables
- call stacks
- program flow

To set a breakpoint:

- Open DevTools
- Go to Sources tab
- Select Page
- Find file
- Click the line number where to pause

demo/breakpoints.html

Once breakpoint is set, reload the page.
It will pause and you will have options:

- Resume Execution (F8)
- Step over next function call (F10)
- Step into next function call (F11)
- Step out of current function (SHIFT + F11)


F8: Runs the app.
F10: Finishes line and jumps to next line.
F11: Goes inside function on current line (if exist), or jumps to next line.
Shift+F11: Finishes current function and jumps to the line right after.


DOM breakpoints

- Select element
- Right click
- Break on ->
  Subtree modifications
  Attribute modifications

Subtree modifications - when child elements
of a DOM element are updated.

Attribute modifications - when attributes of
a DOM element are updated.

Event Listener Breakpoints

Allow to pause JavaScript execution whenever
a specific type of event (click, submit, etc)
is triggered on any element in the page.

When useful?

Debugging Mysterious Event Triggers.
When you don’t know which JS code (handler)
is causing an event (maybe yours or third-party).

How to enable?

- Open DevTools.
- Go to Sources tab.
- Expand the "Event Listener Breakpoints" panel
- Select category and event
Example: Check Mouse → click to pause on any click event.

If you click on a button now,
the debugger will pause execution
and jump to the first line of the handler.

If there is no event listener attached,
the debugger will not pause.

Example, click somewhere on the page
and debugger will not pause the execution.

Debugging techniques

debugger

You can add 'debugger' in your JS
code to pause the execution.
You need to open devtools in order
to see the pause.

demo/debugger.html


console.log()

Log values to the console.
Easiest way to debug.

demo/debugger.html

Let's say I want to understand
why I get NaN?

Add to calculateTax():

console.log(price);
console.log(taxAmount);
console.log(tax);

I can add labels to what I see
in console:

console.log('tax is calculated as ', tax)
